Ready for a game of mixed luck and sratagy?
I created this game because of my love of board games and stratagy games

Take turns and be the first to take down your opponent in this 1 V 1 dice game!

Gameplay:
Each player has 3 rolls to gather the dice they want before the attack phase.
Rolls go back and forth between players until all rolls are used.
Once all rolls are used the attack phase starts.

Deal damage to your opponent By swords or Arrows

HOWEVER Swords are blocked by shields and arrows by helmets on a 1:1 ratio
EX) Player one has 3 arrows and Player 2 has 1 helmet. Player 2 takes 2 damage since the helmet blocks one of the arrows.
EXTRA SHIELDS/HELMETS DO NO DAMAGE

The syths represent a traitor who at the end will deal 2 damage per, for whoever has them. Do you really want to roll with an empty spot and risk it?

Hearts heal on a scale of:
1 heart = 0 health
2 hearts = 1 health
3 hearts = 2 health
4+ = 5 health

Once the atack phase is over, if both players are above 0 health; the game continues

The game can end in a draw
